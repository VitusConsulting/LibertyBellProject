The mission of the Liberty Bell Project is to identify and incentivize companies that have implemented policies and practices that advances economic liberty for all communities. 

We have curated a methodology to score companies on how well they perform in critical measures of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Using DEI data that has been pulled from annual and ESG reports, Twitter, Linkedin, etc, we analyze the different ways companies have implemented DEI strategies to create a more inclusive workplace for their employees.  

Each company is scored based on our 4 pillars of DEI:
- Workforce Promise
- Workplace Culture
- Workforce Protections
- Corporate Social Responsibility
