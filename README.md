The mission of the Liberty Bell Project is to identify and incentivize policies and practices that advances economic liberty for all communities. 

We have curated a methodology to score companies on how well they perform in critical measures of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in a companyâ€™s overall performance. With the use of DEI data that has been pulled from annual reports, ESG reports, Twitter, Linkedin and more, the Liberty Bell Project analyzes the different ways companies have implemented DEI strategies to create a more inclusive workplace for their employees.
