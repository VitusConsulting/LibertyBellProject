#Liberty Bell Project#

The mission of the Liberty Bell Project is to identify and incentivize companies that have implemented policies and practices that advance economic liberty for all communities. Our commitment to this mission is underpinned by a meticulously curated methodology designed to evaluate and score companies based on their performance across critical measures of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).

In our quest to promote economic liberty, we employ a comprehensive data collection approach. This involves sourcing DEI data from a range of channels, including annual reports, ESG reports, and social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn. By tapping into this diverse array of data streams, we gain valuable insights into how companies have implemented DEI strategies to foster a more inclusive workplace environment for their employees.

At the heart of our assessment process lie our four pillars of DEI, which serve as the foundation for scoring each company:

Workforce Promise: Within this pillar, we evaluate a company's commitments and initiatives related to diversity and inclusion within its workforce. This includes assessing the establishment of concrete goals for hiring individuals from underrepresented groups and the cultivation of an environment that prioritizes inclusivity.

Workplace Culture: We delve into the broader workplace culture to gauge how welcoming and inclusive it is for employees from diverse backgrounds. Creating a culture where every voice is valued and respected is a cornerstone of our evaluation.

Workforce Protections: Ensuring that employees' rights are safeguarded, and that fairness and equity are upheld is integral. We examine the measures in place to protect employees within each organization.

Corporate Social Responsibility: Beyond the workplace, we consider a company's commitment to broader social responsibility efforts. This includes analyzing their engagement with local communities, philanthropic endeavors, and sustainability initiatives.

Our scoring process aims to recognize and celebrate those organizations that excel in advancing DEI within their operations. Through this recognition, we aspire to incentivize companies to not only maintain but also expand their efforts in this critical area, ultimately contributing to the realization of greater economic liberty for communities far and wide.

It's important to note that the Liberty Bell Project continually evolves its methodology to stay aligned with evolving standards and best practices in the realm of DEI. Our dedication to promoting economic liberty remains unwavering as we continue to refine our approach and champion the cause of diversity, equity, and inclusion on a broader scale.
